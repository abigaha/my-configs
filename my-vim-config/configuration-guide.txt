A one-time and long-lasting solution
Search for SwitchHosts on GitHub and download the corresponding version. After downloading, open a terminal in the directory where the software installation package is located and run the command:
sudo dpkg -i [enter your software installation package name here]

Then wait for the installation to complete. Open the software, add a host file, select "Remote", and then search for github520 on GitHub. In the text area of github520, find the URL, copy it to the interface that just popped up in SwitchHosts, give the new host file a name, select the update interval, and save it.
After that, the configuration is complete.
Refresh
