Linux Configurations
This repository contains my personal configuration files for various Linux tools and applications. Currently, it only includes my Vim setup, but more configurations may be added over time.

Contents
Vim configuration – located in my-configs/my-vim-config

Purpose
I'm a student sharing my configs primarily as a reference for others who might be looking for ideas or examples. If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request – I'm always happy to learn!

Details
For a complete overview of my Vim setup, including the .vimrc file and any associated plugins or instructions, please check the my-configs/my-vim-config directory.

Feedback
If you spot something that could be done better or have a cool tip, I'd love to hear it! Just open an issue or reach out.

Thanks for stopping by!
